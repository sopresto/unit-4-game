Each bandicoot character should have a random hidden value between 1 - 12.
(These bandicoot characters are depicted by buttons)
The random number shown at the start of the game should be between 19 - 120.
What happens during this game:
Each character needs a random value, when clicked score will reveal in total Score div.
Random number will show inside of randomNumber div at the beginning of the game.
When characters are clicked their values will show within totalScore div.
If score matches that within randomNumber div user will gain one win point. 
If users number does not match that of the random number score will be added to losses div otherwise
score will be added to the wins div.
Game will (reset) upon win or loss and therefore characters begin with a new value as well as randomNumber.
